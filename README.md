### Hi There! Glad you're here! 👋

I'm James Lundin, a software developer passionate in developing eloquent solutions to unique software requirements. I am experienced in many programming languages and frameworks and believe that the best tools to use are the ones that best compliment the task at hand. Because of this belief I am constantly learning new technologies and am able to quickly adapt to any environment.

**My Passions**
- 💻 Development, I actually left a successful career in Facilities Management in 2018 to create my own web development company [The Code Diver](https://thecodediver.com)
- 🤿 Scuba Diving, I first started diving in June of 2017 after completing my open water diver certification through PADI. Then, in July of 2018 I completed my advanced open water diver certification as well as my enriched air diver certification. I have completed dives in Grand Cayman, Cozumel, Belize and Fort Lauderdale.
- 🏆 Sports, I grew up just south of Boston, Ma so sports are in my blood. For this reason I would love to work in the Sports Tech field.
- 🗺️ Travel, I completed my first trip abroad 7 years ago. On that trip, I met my fiance and absolutely fell in love with traveling, meeting new people, and learning about cultures outside of my own. I believe that the only way to grow is through experience, and for me, the best part about traveling is gaining those new experiences, whether is it meeting someone who walks a different path than your own, or experiencing the way a different culture lives. For all these reasons I would also very much enjoy working in the Travel Tech field and help others experience that connection to the world and all the personal growth it brings. 

**What I'm Up To Now**
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... [Half Way There](https://halfwaythere.netlify.app) - A React application for identifying meeting locations in the middle of two addresses based on the type of location input (ie restaurant, or coffee shop)

# Double down on strength

At any given point in time, you can either focus on improving your weaknesses or furthering your strengths.

At Mem Labs, we bias towards doubling down on what is already working — to turn good into great and great into world-class.

This is especially important for early-stage startups, who are either a) looking for a wedge to enter an existing market or b) trying to convert new users towards the creation of a new market (i.e. a religion). 

As a company matures, this will necessarily change (i.e. weaknesses become higher ROI to improve) — but we will always bias towards furthering our strengths.

# Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

It's not an accident that this is the 2nd value listed. The biggest advantage — some would argue _**only**_ — that a startup has over larger incumbents is the ability to move faster (specifically, to make decisions faster and more decisively). 

If we are unwilling to accept the inevitable consequences (e.g. bugs!) that come with our primary advantage then we might as well wire the money back to our investors and join FANG.

This is particularly true of decisions that are reversible (e.g. decisions that are not [trap-door decisions](https://stevecheney.com/avoiding-trapdoor-decisions/)).
